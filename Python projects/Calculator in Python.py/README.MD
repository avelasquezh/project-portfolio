# **Python Calculator**

This is a small console calculator project developed in Python. It demonstrates basic skills in programming logic, user input handling, flow control, and error management.

## **Features:**

- Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles division by zero.
- Validates user input to ensure it consists of numbers.
- Allows the user to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.

## **Skills:**

- Use of functions for code modularization.
- Implementation of conditionals (if, elif, else) for flow control.
- Use of loops (while) for program interactivity.
- Handling of input and output data (input(), print()).
- Data type conversion (float()).
- Exception handling (try-except) for invalid inputs.

## **Execution:**

Clone the repository:

Bash
git clone [https://github.com/avelasquezh/Port.git](https://github.com/avelasquezh/Port.git)
cd your-repository-name
Execute the Python script: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the calculadora_simple.py file, and run the following command:
Bash
python calculadora_simple.py
Requirements: Python > 3
