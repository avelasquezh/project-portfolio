# Guess the Number Game in Python

This is a simple console-based "Guess the Number" game developed in Python. It's a great project for demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and interactive application development.

## Features:

* The computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100.
* The user tries to guess the number.
* The game provides hints ("Too high!", "Too low!") after each guess.
* It tracks and displays the number of attempts taken by the user.
* Includes input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number within the specified range.
* Allows the user to play until they guess the correct number.

## Skills Demonstrated:

* **Random Number Generation:** Use of the `random` module.
* **Loop Control:** Implementation of `while` loops for game interactivity.
* **Conditional Logic:** Use of `if`, `elif`, `else` statements for game rules and feedback.
* **User Input and Output:** Handling user input (`input()`) and providing clear feedback (`print()`).
* **Data Type Conversion:** Converting string input to integer (`int()`).
* **Error Handling:** Implementation of `try-except` blocks to manage invalid user inputs (e.g., non-numeric entries).
* **Basic Game Logic:** Structuring a simple interactive game.

## Execution:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/avelasquezh/project-portfolio.git](https://github.com/avelasquezh/project-portfolio.git)
    cd project-portfolio/guess_the_number_game # Navigate to the specific project folder
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to adjust the `cd` command based on how you organize your projects within your `project-portfolio` repository.)*

2.  **Execute the Python script:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the `guess_the_number.py` file, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python guess_the_number.py
    ```

## Requirements:

* Python 3.x
