# Guess the Number Game in Python

This is a simple console-based "Guess the Number" game developed in Python. It's a great project for demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and interactive application development.

## Features:

* The computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100.
* The user tries to guess the number.
* The game provides hints ("Too high!", "Too low!") after each guess.
* It tracks and displays the number of attempts taken by the user.
* Includes input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number within the specified range.
* Allows the user to play until they guess the correct number.

## Skills Demonstrated:

* **Random Number Generation:** Use of the `random` module.
* **Loop Control:** Implementation of `while` loops for game interactivity.
* **Conditional Logic:** Use of `if`, `elif`, `else` statements for game rules and feedback.
* **User Input and Output:** Handling user input (`input()`) and providing clear feedback (`print()`).
* **Data Type Conversion:** Converting string input to integer (`int()`).
* **Error Handling:** Implementation of `try-except` blocks to manage invalid user inputs (e.g., non-numeric entries).
* **Basic Game Logic:** Structuring a simple interactive game.

## Execution:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/avelasquezh/project-portfolio.git](https://github.com/avelasquezh/project-portfolio.git)
    cd project-portfolio/guess_the_number_game # Navigate to the specific project folder
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to adjust the `cd` command based on how you organize your projects within your `project-portfolio` repository.)*

2.  **Execute the Python script:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the `guess_the_number.py` file, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python guess_the_number.py
    ```

## Requirements:

* Python 3.x

### English Grammar Retroalimentation

Thank you for asking for feedback on your English! It's a great way to learn. Let's look at your last sentence:

**Your sentence:** "now in english, let's continue with the number three prject, please have in mind this URL for the Author:"

Here's a breakdown and suggested improvements:

1.  **"now in english,"**
    * **Feedback:** This is perfectly understandable and common.
    * **Alternative (slightly more formal/fluid):** "Now, in English," (adding a comma after 'Now' for a brief pause) or "Moving to English now,".

2.  **"let's continue with the number three prject,"**
    * **Feedback:**
        * "prject" is a **typo**. It should be **"project"**.
        * "the number three project" is grammatically correct but can sound a bit literal.
    * **Alternative:** "let's continue with Project Number 3," or simply "let's continue with Project 3,".

3.  **"please have in mind this URL for the Author:"**
    * **Feedback:** "have in mind" is understandable but slightly more direct or informal in this context. It's a direct translation of "tener en cuenta."
    * **Alternative (more natural English phrasing):**
        * "please **keep in mind** this URL for the author section:" (using "keep in mind" is more common for ongoing awareness)
        * "please **note** this URL for the author:" (simple and direct)
        * "please **use** this URL for the author's information:" (if you want me to *apply* it)

**Revised sentence with improvements:**

"Now, in English, let's continue with Project 3. Please **note** this URL for the author section:"

**Key Takeaways for your learning:**

* **Proofread for typos:** Simple errors like "prject" are easily caught by re-reading.
* **Common Phrasing:** While direct translations are often understandable, listening to or reading how native speakers express similar ideas can help you internalize more natural-sounding phrases (e.g., "keep in mind" vs. "have in mind").
* **Specificity:** In formal or technical contexts, being precise helps ("Project 3" instead of "the number three project" is slightly more common).

You are doing great! Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask for more feedback.
